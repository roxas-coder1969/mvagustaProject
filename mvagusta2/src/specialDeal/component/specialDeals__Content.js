            MV Agusta is launching commercial initiatives on Euro 4 bikes
            available at dealers.
          </p>

          <p>
            MV Agusta is announcing a sell-out campaign, focusing on its Euro 4
            models available at dealers across European markets. An opportunity
            for enthusiasts of the brand to secure a brand new MV Agusta as
            recent as the latest 2020 models.
          </p>

          <p>
            The initiative, coming under different names in the various markets
            (Italy, UK, Germany, France, Spain and Benelux), consists in
            commercial promotions and trade-in support for the purchase of a
            model in stock at participating dealers, with the exclusion of Rush,
            Brutale 1000 RR and special editions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The campaign is part of the companyâ€™s strategy to expand its
            consumer base across all markets, consolidating its loyal core,
            attracting first-timers and acquiring new customers among younger
            generation bikers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The campaign started on February 15th and will close on March 31st,
            2021, or until stocks are exhausted.
